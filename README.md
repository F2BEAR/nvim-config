# NVIM Config

This is the repo for my nvim configuration files; just a LazyVim conf with some basic changes to the starting repo template.

If you are using Windows as I do, you should place this into ~/AppData/Local/nvim folder.

I got a custom configuration to atuomatically shown hiden files in the neo-tree file explorer, and I would probably add configurations to use github's copilot, toggle-term, some theming, etc.

Let's see where this get us.
